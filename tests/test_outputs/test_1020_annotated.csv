Number of lines of special comments,11
Special comments line 1,Example of FFI 1020 (a).
Special comments line 2,This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 1020 combines the US Standard
Special comments line 3,Atmosphere 1976 (for the auxiliary variables Pressure and Air Concentration) and some
Special comments line 4,results of a 1-D model (for the dependent variables - oxygen compounds concentrations),
Special comments line 5,as quoted in G. Brasseur and S. Solomon, Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere, Reidel,
Special comments line 6,1984 (pp. 46 & 211). The first date on line 7 (1st of January 1976) is fictitious since
Special comments line 7,the parameters are yearly averages. We have signalled the absence of calculated values at
Special comments line 8,30 and 105 km by using the "missing value" flags (see line 13). The missing value flag
Special comments line 9,is also used to give account for the fact that there is virtually no O(1D) present below
Special comments line 10,the altitude of 20 km. Note that the data are identical as the data contained in the
Special comments line 11,example illustrating FFI 1010, but in a more compact format.
Number of lines of normal comments,9
Normal comments line 1,The files included in this data set illustrate each of the 9 NASA Ames file format indices
