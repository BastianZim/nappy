Example of FFI 1010.
This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 1010 combines the US Standard
Atmosphere 1976 (for the auxiliary variables Pressure and Air Concentration) and some
results of a 1-D model (for the dependent variables - oxygen compounds concentrations),
as quoted in G. Brasseur and S. Solomon, Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere,
Reidel, 1984 (pp. 46 & 211). The first date on line 7 (1st of January 1976) is fictitious
since the parameters are yearly averages. We have signalled the absence of calculated
value at 30 km by using the "missing value" flags (see line 12). The missing value flag
is also used to give account for the fact that there is virtually no O(1D) present below
the altitude of 20 km.
