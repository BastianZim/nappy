Example of FFI 2160.
This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 2160 is entirely fictitious. Data
have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They consist in
imaginary simultaneous measurements of tropospheric NOX and ozone mixing ratios at three
sites. A time series is provided for each site and each species. Measurements are
supposed to have taken place every 10 minutes. The 4th and 5th auxiliary variables give
the time of the first measurement of the series.

The files included in this data set illustrate each of the 9 NASA Ames file format
indices (FFI). A detailed description of the NASA Ames format can be found on the Web
site of the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) at
