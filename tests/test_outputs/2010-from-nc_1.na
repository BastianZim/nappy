Example of FFI 2010 (b).
This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 2010 is based on results
from Murgatroyd (1969) as displayed in Brasseur and Solomon, Aeronomy of the
Middle Atmosphere, Reidel, 1984 (p.36). It is representative of the mean zonal
wind distribution in the winter hemisphere as a function of latitude and height.
The first date on line 7 (1st of January 1969) is fictitious.
From line 10 (NXDEF = 1) we know that the latitude points are defined by
X(i) = X(1) + (i-1)DX1 for i = 1, ..., NX
with X(1) = 0 deg (line 11), DX1 = 10 deg (line 8) and NX = 9 (line 9).
  Variable mean_zonal_wind: Mean zonal wind (m/s)
    name = variable_2
    title = Mean zonal wind
    long_name = Mean zonal wind
    units = m/s
