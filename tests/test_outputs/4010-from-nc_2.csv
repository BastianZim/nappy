Example of FFI 4010.
This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 4010 is entirely fictitious.
Data have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They
consist in an imaginary calculated temperature distribution over a longitude-lati-
tude-altitude grid at 6 o'clock and noon on the 21st of June 1980. The grid is
defined in lines 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. Longitude ranges from 30 degrees West to 30
degrees East by intervals of 5 degrees. Latitude ranges from 90 North to 90 South by
negative intervals of 30 degrees. Altitude takes the two values of 20 and 50 km.
If the temperature is written as T(lon, lat, alt, time), the record below thus reads,
for each of the two times t = 6 and t = 12,
t
T(-30, 90, 20, t) . . . T(30, 90, 20, t)

T(-30, -90, 20, t). . . T(30, -90, 20, t)
