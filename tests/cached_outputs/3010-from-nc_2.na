Example of FFI 3010.
This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 3010 is entirely fictitious.
Data have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They
consist in an imaginary calculated temperature distribution over a latitude-altitude
grid at the two solstices (21 June and 21 December). The grid is defined in lines 8,
9, 11 and 12. Latitude ranges from -90 to +90 degrees by intervals of 30 degrees.
Altitude ranges from 50 to 20 km by negative increments of 10 km.
The day number is counted from 1st of January = Day One.
The year of the first date on line 7 (1980) has no particular meaning.
