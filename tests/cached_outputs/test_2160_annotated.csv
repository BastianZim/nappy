Number of lines of special comments,7
Special comments line 1,Example of FFI 2160.
Special comments line 2,This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 2160 is entirely fictitious. Data
Special comments line 3,have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They consist in
Special comments line 4,imaginary simultaneous measurements of tropospheric NOX and ozone mixing ratios at three
Special comments line 5,sites. A time series is provided for each site and each species. Measurements are
Special comments line 6,supposed to have taken place every 10 minutes. The 4th and 5th auxiliary variables give
Special comments line 7,the time of the first measurement of the series.
Number of lines of normal comments,10
Normal comments line 1,The files included in this data set illustrate each of the 9 NASA Ames file format
