Special comments line 1,Example of FFI 3010.
Special comments line 2,This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 3010 is entirely fictitious.
Special comments line 3,Data have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They
Special comments line 4,consist in an imaginary calculated temperature distribution over a latitude-altitude
Special comments line 5,grid at the two solstices (21 June and 21 December). The grid is defined in lines 8,
Special comments line 6,9, 11 and 12. Latitude ranges from -90 to +90 degrees by intervals of 30 degrees.
Special comments line 7,Altitude ranges from 50 to 20 km by negative increments of 10 km.
Special comments line 8,The day number is counted from 1st of January = Day One.
Special comments line 9,The year of the first date on line 7 (1980) has no particular meaning.
