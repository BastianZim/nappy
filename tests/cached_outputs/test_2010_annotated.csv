Special comments line 1,Example of FFI 4010.
Special comments line 2,This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 4010 is entirely fictitious.
Special comments line 3,Data have been made up for the purpose of illustrating the use of the format. They

Special comments line 5,tude-altitude grid at 6 o'clock and noon on the 21st of June 1980. The grid is
Special comments line 6,defined in lines 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. Longitude ranges from 30 degrees West to 30
Special comments line 7,degrees East by intervals of 5 degrees. Latitude ranges from 90 North to 90 South by
