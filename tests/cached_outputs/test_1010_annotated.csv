Number of lines of special comments,10
Special comments line 1,Example of FFI 1010.
Special comments line 2,This example illustrating NASA Ames file format index 1010 combines the US Standard
Special comments line 3,Atmosphere 1976 (for the auxiliary variables Pressure and Air Concentration) and some
Special comments line 4,results of a 1-D model (for the dependent variables - oxygen compounds concentrations),
Special comments line 5,as quoted in G. Brasseur and S. Solomon, Aeronomy of the Middle Atmosphere,
Special comments line 6,Reidel, 1984 (pp. 46 & 211). The first date on line 7 (1st of January 1976) is fictitious
Special comments line 7,since the parameters are yearly averages. We have signalled the absence of calculated
Special comments line 8,value at 30 km by using the "missing value" flags (see line 12). The missing value flag
Special comments line 9,is also used to give account for the fact that there is virtually no O(1D) present below
Special comments line 10,the altitude of 20 km.
